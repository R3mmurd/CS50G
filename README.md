# [HarvardX: CS50G](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/course/)

This repository contains my solutions to the projects of this course.
You should not use these codes for your own solutions in case you are doing
the course. But you could study them for learning purposes.

In this course, the instructor made eleven game projects. Each of them was studied
in a two-hours-class. Then, we had to do an assignment over each game. In the end,
we had to develop a complete game as a final project based on minimum requirements.

The following list of subdirectories contains each of the assignments:

- **assignment0**: Contains the implementation of a remake of Pong. The assignment was
to implement a basic AI for either Player 1 or 2 (or both!). See details
[here](assignment0/README.md).

- **assignment1**: Contains the implementation of a remake of Flappy Bird. The assignment was:
Influence the generation of pipes so as to bring about more complicated level generation,
give the player a medal for their performance, along with their score, and
implement a pause feature, just in case life gets in the way of jumping through pipes!.
See details [here](assignment1/README.md).

- **assignment2**: Contains the implementation of a remake of Breakout. The assignment was:
Add a powerup to the game that spawns two extra balls,
grow and shrink the Paddle when the player gains enough points or loses a life, and
add a locked Brick that will only open when the player collects a second new powerup, a key,
which should only spawn when such a Brick exists and randomly as per the Ball powerup.
See details [here](assignment2/README.md).
