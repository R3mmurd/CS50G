# [HarvardX: CS50G](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/course/)

This repository contains my solutions to the projects of this course.
You should not use these codes for your own solutions in case you are doing
the course. But you could study them for learning purposes.

In this course, the instructor made eleven game projects. Each of them was studied
in a two-hours-class. Then, we had to do an assignment over each game. In the end,
we had to develop a complete game as a final project based on minimum requirements.

The following list of subdirectories contains each of the assignments:

**assignment0**: Contains the implementation of Pong game. The assignment was
to implement a basic AI for either Player 1 or 2 (or both!). See details
[here](assignment0/README.md).
