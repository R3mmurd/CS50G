# “Helicopter Game 3D, The Gem Update”

## The goal

- Add Gems to the game that spawn in much the same way as Coins, though more rarely so.
  Gems should be worth 5 coins when collected and despawn when off the left edge of the screen.

- Fix the bug whereby the scroll speed of planes, coins, and buildings doesn’t reset when the game is
  restarted via the space bar.
