# “Flappy Bird, The Reward Update”

## The goal

- Randomize the gap between pipes (vertical space), such that they’re no longer
  hardcoded to 90 pixels.

- Randomize the interval at which pairs of pipes spawn, such that they’re no longer
  always 2 seconds apart.

- When a player enters the ScoreState, award them a “medal” via an image displayed along
  with the score; this can be any image or any type of medal you choose (e.g., ribbons,
  actual medals, trophies, etc.), so long as each is different and based on the points they
  scored that life. Choose 3 different ones, as well as the minimum score needed for each one.

- Implement a pause feature, such that the user can simply press “P” (or some other key)
  and pause the state of the game. When they pause the game, a simple sound effect should play.
  At the same time this sound effect plays, the music should pause, and once the user presses P again,
  the gameplay and the music should resume just as they were! To cap it off, display a pause icon in
  the middle of the screen, nice and large, so as to make it clear the game is paused.
