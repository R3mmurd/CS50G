# “Match-3, The Shiny Update”

## The goal

- Implement time addition on matches, such that scoring a match extends the timer by 1 second per tile in a match.

- Ensure Level 1 starts just with simple flat blocks, with later levels
  generating the blocks with patterns on them (like the triangle, cross, etc.).

- Create random shiny versions of blocks that will destroy an entire row on match, granting points for each block in the row.

- Only allow swapping when it results in a match. If there are no matches available to perform, reset the board.

- (Optional) Implement matching using the mouse.
