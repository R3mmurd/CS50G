# “Portal, The ProBuilder Update”

## The goal

- Create your own level in a new scene using ProBuilder and ProGrids!

- Ensure that the level has an FPSController to navigate with in the scene.

- Ensure that there is an object or region with a trigger at the very end that will trigger
  the end of the level (some zone with an invisible BoxCollider will work).

- When the level ends, display “You Won!” on the screen with a Text object.
