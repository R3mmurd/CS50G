# “Pong, The AI Update”

## The goal

- Implement an AI-controlled paddle (either the left or the right will do) such that
  it will try to deflect the ball at all times. Since the paddle can move on only one
  axis (the Y axis), you will need to determine how to keep the paddle moving in relation
  to the ball. Currently, each paddle has its own chunk of code where input is detected by
  the keyboard; this feels like an excellent place to put the code we need! Once either the
  left or right paddle (or both, if desired) try to deflect the paddle on their own, you’ve
  done it!
