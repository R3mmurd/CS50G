# “Super Mario Bros., The Key and Lock Update”

## The goal

- Program it such that when the player is dropped into the level, they’re always done so above solid ground.
  
- In LevelMaker.lua, generate a random-colored key and lock block . The key should unlock the block when the player collides with it,
  triggering the block to disappear.

- Once the lock has disappeared, trigger a goal post to spawn at the end of the level.

- When the player touches this goal post, we should regenerate the level, spawn the player at the beginning of it again,
  and make it a little longer than it was before.
