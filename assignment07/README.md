# “Pokémon, The Level-Up Update”

## The goal

- Implement a Menu that appears during the player Pokémon’s level up that shows, for each stat, ‘X + Y = Z’,
  where X is the starting stat, Y is the amount it’s increased for this level, and Z is the resultant sum.
  This Menu should appear right after the “Level Up” dialogue that appears at the end of a victory where the
  player has indeed leveled up.
